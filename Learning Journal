4/10/22 - I first decided on what 4 projects I wanted to do. I decided on my first project where the player can control the character’s movement within a 3D environment in third person. I chose something easy for my first project to help refresh my memory and to not make it too difficult for me. I started by watching tutorials from the likes of Brackeys on youtube and reading through unity documentation for the basics to help my understanding.

11/10/22 Finishing off my first project, In this script I have used a character controller; I have learnt that it will allow the player to move easily based on collisions so it doesn’t fall through the floor, therefore there is no need to use a rigidbody. I had originally chose to do a script this way however trying to fine tune the movements was a bit difficult whereas the character controller allowed me to move exactly how I wanted.
